Hi {{member.first_name}},

Farmigo, our online signup provider, included the wrong workshift link in your signup confirmation email. If you tried signing up for a workshift, it probably looked as though all the workshifts had been taken. Sorry for any confusion around this.

Here's your correct workshift signup link:

Hope you're enjoying the beginning of spring as much as we are. Can't wait to see you in June!
